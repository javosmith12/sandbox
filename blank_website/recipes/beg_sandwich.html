    <h3 class="desc-title">Description</h3>
    <p class="desc">This NY style "BEC" is simply amazing. One bite, and you'll feel like you're walking out of a local bodega with an Arizona iced tea in one hand and a good vibe in the other.</p>
    <ul class="ing-list">
        <li>4 strips of bacon</li>
        <li>2 rolls, sliced in half</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>4 slices of American cheese</li>
        <li>salt, pepper, ketchup to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <ol class="unord-list">
        <li>Put bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels.</li>
        <li>Melt some butter or use spray in a large nonstick pan or griddle over low heat. Add Kaiser rolls, cut sides down, and toast until lightly golden, about 3 minutes. Remove and set aside.</li>
        <li>Pour half the eggs into the pan, and cook as if making an omelet, pushing eggs aside and lifting to allow uncooked egg to run underneath. Once egg is cooked, layer egg, bacon, and cheese on each kaiser roll.</li>
        <li>Serve with ketchup.</li>
    </ol>
